# Hangman Game Readme->

This code is a simple implementation of the classic game "Hangman" in Perl. The game randomly selects a word from a
predefined array of words, and the player has to guess the word by suggesting individual characters. 
The game provides a figure of a hanged man, and the figure is updated after each incorrect guess.

## How to run-->
* Assuming you have the Perl interpreter installed on your computer, you can execute this code by opening a terminal or command prompt.
* Navigate to the directory where the file is saved.

## To run the program, type the following command:
`perl hangman.pl`
This will start the program and you will see the output in the terminal or command prompt.
